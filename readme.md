**This will be a simple example of how to use the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK with Vite.**
This npm command will create a new Vite project in the current directory. 
```bash
npm create vite@latest .
```
This will install the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK.
```bash
npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk
```
This runs the Vite development server.
